This repository contains the code and datasets used in my Master dissertation, which focuses on climate data analysis and visualization for Ireland and Germany, and its application to ecological experiments.

# Dataset and Jupiter notebook files used in this project 
## For Ireland
1. For Regional climate analysis in Ireland to study climate variability across different areas the all_yearly.csv dataset is used  and the code can be found on [Regional_analysis_Ireland](https://nbviewer.org/github/roshan36691/Studying-Ireland-s-Climate-Change-Indices/blob/main/Code/Regional_analysis_Ireland.ipynb)
2. For seasonal climate analysis in Ireland all_season.csv dataset is used and the code can be found on Seasonal_analysis_Ireland.
3. For Developing interactive maps for visualizing climate data in Ireland  all_yearly.csv and Weather (1).xlsx dataset is used and the code can be found on Interactive maps_Ireland.

## For Germany
1. For Regional climate analysis in Germany to study climate variability across different areas the Final dataset of germany.csv and Stations_with_Directions.csv is used and the code can be found on Regional_analysis_Germany
2. For data analysis of the ecological Experiment, which focuses on the effects of climate on biodiversity Final dataset of germany.csv and Biomass1.csv and Biomass2.csv and Biomass3.csv and climate.csv is used and the code can be found on Impact_on_Ecological_system_Germany

## For comparision of countries
1. Comparative analysis of climate trends between Ireland and Germany is carried out. For this all_season.csv and all_yearly.csv and final_table_Germany.csv is used and the code can be found on Comparision_of_countries

## Web app development
1. The web app is designed to visualize and interact with climate data, offering user-friendly interfaces for exploring trends, comparing indices, and more. The web app deployed can be accessed directly by using the link: https://climatepredictions.shinyapps.io/apppy/
